# E-commerce App

Welcome to the E-commerce App repository! This project is built using Node.js and Express for the server, MongoDB Atlas for the database, and EJS as the templating engine.

It utilizes a .env file to store environment variables such as PORT and MONGO_URL.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd e-commerce-app
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```plaintext
PORT=3000
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
```

Make sure to replace `your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server on the specified port (default is 3000). You can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
